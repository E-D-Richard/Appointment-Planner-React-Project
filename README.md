# Appointment Planner Project

## Built with React

[view WebApp at:](http://localhost:3000)

### Current Build

Currently app only has front- end functionality. Input data is not sent nto a backend server and a result all data is lost upon a page refresh.  
  
#### Future Updates

Work on solving the console warning "use default value etc" (in ContactPicker.js).
Fix issue - contact choice remains selected/filled-out in contact input field after submitting form.
